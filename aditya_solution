## Your second approach below (strings.txt)

Reasoning -used linux command to find the string txt(using cd find and grep)
DabAWF1UenBD2W
kPVEQPc6ZN8x2jn
g4JoMqFZyat9vd5
ORNwuwGtKDLydge
TqMuGims7vlJtno
8dc2evcCSSc4kUy (password)



## Your third approach below (fourth.zip)

Reasoning - %%% as 8dc2evcCSSc4kUy (password) does not open up fourth file
And after seeing other txt file containg similar passwords in it.
I ran the command
aditya@LAPTOP-AE2SA9A9:/mnt/d/Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack$ grep -r "8dc2evcCSSc4kUy"
1/5/0/3/strings.txt:8dc2evcCSSc4kUy (password)
eleven.txt:8dc2evcCSSc4kUy
final.txt:8dc2evcCSSc4kUy
tells us that same string is also contained in final as well as eleven.txt

where eleven.txt is required password for fourth.zip 
after unzipping fourth.zip
used grep to find DevOps{..}strings

```
%%% DevOps{y0ur3_4w350m3_4nd_0ne_5t3p_c1053r}%%%
```
